# Python Advanced Topics 

This repository contains some advanced Python topics that I worked out throughout time. 

It contains some Jupyter notebooks per category.

To get going, clone this repository, create a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and... go.
```
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
